# Blog Web Application using Appwrite

This template provides a minimal setup to create a Blog Web Application using Appwrite as a Backend as a Service (BaaS) solution. Appwrite is an open-source platform that simplifies backend development by providing ready-to-use APIs and services.

- File Storage: With Appwrite, you can easily upload and manage files associated with your blog posts, such as images or attachments.
- Real-time Updates: Appwrite supports real-time updates through webhooks and event listeners, allowing you to implement features like live comments or notifications.
- Custom Business Logic: Appwrite allows you to write custom server-side functions using your preferred programming language, giving you full control over your application's backend logic.
